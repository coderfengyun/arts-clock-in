1. Defensive programming is good to have.
2. Best practises: simplicity, the simpler the code, and the less it does, the lower chance of vulnerability; reuse, extensively used code is better; readability; test coverage;
3. Antipatterns: reentrancy, modify state after Contract Call is a problem. Do it reversely or use muted.
