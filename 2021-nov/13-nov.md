Master Ethereum chapter9 security
1. Pseudo Entropy problem: rely on the information on the future's block. The miner maybe cheat here, eg. Give up the unti-self-benefit block. 
   How to solve? Use a outside-of-chain Oracle; Through commit-and-reveal pattern. Or through change a group of particupant's trust model.
