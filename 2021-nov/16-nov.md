Mastering Ethereum chapter12 dapp
1. DApp contains de-centralized app's everything, include storage, message passing, naming service etc.
2. What a dapp contains: backend, frontend, storage, messaging, naming service. Every component may be centralized or decentralized. For eg. frontend canbe developed to deploy on centralized server or on your device's mobile app.
3. Dapp's advantage: elasticity, transparency, anti-investigate.
4. Backend: Smart Contract: as small as possible. Central/most important part should act in a Contract way. High cost gas and immutable.
5. Frontend: 
6. Storage: ipfs or swarm.
7. Messaging: whisper
8. ENS: like dns, eip-137 define functionality, eip-162 defines .eth's auction system, eip-181 defines reverse register rule.
9. Naming hash: ens(a.b.c) = keccak(ens(b.c) + keccak(a)); 
10. Question for end: why it will decode to a unique a.b.c?
