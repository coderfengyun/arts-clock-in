## Today's Recommanded Topics
1. 《Master Ethereum》Chapter 4 Or Chapter8

## coderfengyun's review
Vyper: 
1. common vulnerabilities: Suicidal contracts, Greedy contracts, Prodigal contracts. 
2. Comparision to Solidity: no function modifiers, use inline checks instead. If modifying, make it explicitly.
3. vyper don't support inheritance.
4. vyper don't support Assembly (low level access to EVM instructions)
5. vyper don't support overloading.
6. vyper don't support implicitly typecasting. Its type casting will throw exception if overflow.
7. Recommanded style : precondition -> state changes -> postconditions.
8. vyper claim a given smart contract's code should exist in one file. vyper clain every variable or function should be declared before used.
9. vyper has built-in overflow protection. buildt on LLL.
10. vyper is a powerful and interesting contract language. Design towards correctness, at the expense of some flexibility.

## Dingding's Review
1. 今天看完了第四张和第五章的一半，第五章涉及了一些密码学的知识，比较感兴趣，准备翻些额外的资料再补补课。
